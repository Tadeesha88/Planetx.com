            <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, characterized by extreme temperature variations. Its surface is
                a desolate, cratered landscape, with scorching daytime temperatures of up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430
                degrees Celsius) and frigid nighttime temperatures as low as -290 degrees Fahrenheit (-180 degrees
                Celsius). It has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of oxygen, sodium, and hydrogen. Mercury has a
                slow rotation, completing just one rotation in about 59 Earth days, while its year is approximately 88
                Earth days long. It has no moons.</p>

            <p>Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition but has a hellish
                environment. It has a thick, toxic atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, causing a runaway
                greenhouse effect. Surface temperatures can soar up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius),
                hotter than Mercury despite being farther from the Sun. Venus has a slow, retrograde rotation, taking
                about 243 Earth days to complete one day-night cycle. It lacks moons and is marked by numerous volcanoes
                and rocky terrain.</p>

            <p>Earth is the only known planet with abundant life, characterized by a diverse range of ecosystems and
                climates. It has a stable atmosphere, essential for supporting life, primarily composed of nitrogen and
                oxygen. The planet orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 93 million miles (150 million
                kilometers) and completes one orbit in 365.25 days. Earth's surface features oceans, continents,
                mountains, and a variety of geological formations. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, which plays a
                crucial role in ocean tides and Earth's rotational stability.</p>

            <p>Mars, often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to its rusty appearance, has intrigued scientists with
                the possibility of past or present life. It has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide
                and a cold, arid surface with polar ice caps. Mars has a day just slightly longer than Earth's, about
                24.6 hours, and a year that lasts approximately 687 Earth days. It features the largest volcano in the
                solar system, Olympus Mons, and a vast canyon system known as Valles Marineris. Mars also has two small
                moons, Phobos and Deimos.</p>

        <div class="planet-text">
            <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, a massive gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and
                helium. It boasts a powerful magnetic field and numerous moons, with the largest being Ganymede, even
                larger than Mercury. Jupiter has distinct cloud bands and a massive storm system called the Great Red
                Spot. Its rapid rotation results in a day lasting less than 10 hours, while its year is about 12 Earth
                years long. Jupiter's immense gravity influences the orbits of nearby objects and plays a crucial role
                in protecting the inner planets from potential asteroid impacts.</p>

            <p>Saturn, another gas giant, is famous for its stunning ring system, composed of icy particles and rock
                fragments. It has a similar composition to Jupiter, primarily hydrogen and helium. Saturn's rings are
                made up of countless individual rings and divisions. The planet has a slightly longer day than Jupiter,
                taking about 10.7 hours to rotate, and a year that lasts approximately 29.5 Earth years. Saturn has
                numerous moons, including Titan, known for its thick atmosphere and potential for liquid methane lakes.

        </div>
        <div class="planet-text">
            <p>Uranus is an ice giant with a unique feature: it rotates on its side, likely due to a past collision. Its
                atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane, giving it a bluish-green appearance.
                Uranus has a long day, taking about 17.2 hours to complete one rotation, and its year lasts about 84
                Earth years. It has a system of faint rings and a collection of small moons. Uranus' extreme tilt
                results in extreme seasonal variations, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight
                followed by 42 years of darkness.</p>

            <p>Neptune, the farthest known planet from the Sun, is also an ice giant with a deep blue hue due to its
                methane-rich atmosphere. It has a day lasting about 16 hours and a year lasting roughly 165 Earth years.
                Neptune's winds are among the fastest in the solar system, with gusts reaching up to 1,200 miles per
                hour (1,930 kilometers per hour). It has a ring system and numerous moons, including Triton, which
                orbits in a retrograde direction and is believed to be a captured Kuiper Belt object.</p>
